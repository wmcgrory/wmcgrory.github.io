  <h1>Why he is #3 in 2020</h1>
    <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo is unlike any player the league has ever seen. His combination of speed and size is almost unfair to his opponents. He is unstoppable in the open court and around the rim. The only thing preventing him from being considered one of the greatest players of all-time is his jumpsuit. He has won back-to-back MVP awards without being a very good shooter. However, this fault has held him back in playoffs when the defense gets tougher and the game becomes slower paced. This will be another extraordinary year for Antetokounmpo, but he will ultimately be measured by the success of his team in the playoffs. A title would vault him up these rankings, but for now he has to settle for being third in my rankings.</p>
