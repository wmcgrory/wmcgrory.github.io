  <h1>Why he is #2 in 2020</h1>
    <p>Kawhi Leonard is the best two-way player in the game. He can give you 30 points any night of the week while shutting down the best player on the opposing team. He has been hampered by a lingering quad injury the past two seasons which has limited the amount of games he has played in those years. However, come playoff time everyone knows he is one of the most dangerous players in the NBA. He has led two different teams to a title, and this upcoming season could see him taking his third team, the Los Angeles Clippers, to his next championship.</p>
